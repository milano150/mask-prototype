# 🕯️ MUKHA TEJAH

### A myth-powered survival horror where switching ancient masks is the only way to stay alive.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Most horror games rely on jump scares or repetitive combat. Very few focus on **strategic decision-making under pressure**, and even fewer integrate **Indian mythology as a core gameplay mechanic** rather than just visual flavor.

Players often want meaningful choices, cultural depth, and mechanics that force real trade-offs. This project explores exactly that.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

**Mukha Tejah** is a top-down survival horror game built using **Pygame and Python**, where the player wears mythological masks—each granting a powerful ability along with a dangerous limitation.

The player must **constantly switch masks in real time** to adapt, survive, and outthink incoming ghosts.

**The game turns mythology into a live combat strategy system.**

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

- Play as a masked warrior trapped in a haunted realm
- Ghosts continuously spawn and hunt the player
- Survival depends on switching between different mythological masks
- Each mask offers a powerful ability but introduces a critical weakness
- Poor decisions lead to instant death

**Win Condition:** Survive the ghost waves  
**Lose Condition:** Getting overwhelmed due to wrong mask choice

---

## 🧿 Core Mechanic: The Mask System

The central mechanic of the game is **real-time mask switching**, inspired by Indian mythological figures.  
Each mask enforces **risk vs reward gameplay**, ensuring no ability is overpowered.

### 🔥 Theyyam Mask

- **Power:** Fire throwing attack 
- **Strength:** Effective against a ghost
- **Disability:** Low movement speed

Best used for crowd control, but dangerous when mobility is required.

---

### 🦅 Garudan Mask

- **Power:** Extreme movement speed
- **Strength:** Ideal for escaping and repositioning
- **Disability:** If a ghost touches the player, they get stunned and cannot move temporarily

High-risk mobility—speed saves you, but one mistake can be fatal.

---

### ⚔️ Kali Mask

- **Power:** Sword combat; enemies die in strike and double attack is possible
- **Strength:** Extremely powerful close-range attacks 
- **Disability:** Low visibility range

Deadly but terrifying—what you cannot see can kill you.

## 🔄 Strategic Gameplay Loop

1. Ghosts approach the player  
2. Player evaluates the threat  
3. Mask is switched based on the situation  
4. Ability is used  
5. Weakness must be managed  
6. Loop continues under increasing pressure  

There is no perfect mask—only perfect decisions.
